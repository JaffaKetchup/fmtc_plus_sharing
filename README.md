## Supporting Me

I work on all of my projects in my spare time, including maintaining (along with a team) Flutter's â„– 1 (non-commercially maintained) mapping library 'flutter_map', bringing it back from the brink of abandonment, as well as my own plugin for it ('flutter_map_tile_caching') that extends it with advanced caching and downloading.  
Additionally, I also own the Dart encoder/decoder for the QOI image format ('dqoi') - and I am slowly working on 'flutter_osrm', a wrapper for the Open Source Routing Machine.

Sponsorships & donations allow me to continue my projects and upgrade my hardware/setup, as well as allowing me to have some starting amount for further education and such-like.
And of course, a small amount will find its way into my Jaffa Cakes fund (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaffa_Cakes>) - why do you think my username has "Jaffa" in it?
Many thanks for any amount you can spare, it means a lot to me!

You can read more about me and what I do on my [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/JaffaKetchup) page, where you can donate as well.

Alternatively, if you prefer not to use GitHub Sponsors, please feel free to use my [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/jaffaketchup). Note that the PayPal backend will take a small percentage amount of donations made through this method.
